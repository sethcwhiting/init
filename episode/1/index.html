Jake is working on learning anything related to JavaScript and talks about the challenge of understanding the base knowledge necessary to search things properly. He also talks about his difficulty understanding the difference between website and web app development. Seth also goes on to explain the difference between front-end and back-end development.</p> <p>The conversation touches on the importance of the development community in programming. Seth explains the spirit of collaboration and cooperation that is deeply ingrained in the development community, with open-source development and Git making it easy to collaborate with other developers. They also discuss the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, and how WordPress templates work, advising Jake that WordPress is an excellent place to start if he wants to learn coding.</p> <p>Special thanks to <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/artist/7JxrbI1DZLSJUyzsrBQop2?si=Vt5jO60AR3C4O_wgt9yxkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diarrhea Planet</a> for our intro and outro music and <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/skratchtopo">@SkratchTopo</a> for our artwork.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
